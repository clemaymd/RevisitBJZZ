## Overview

This README file provides information about the implementation of the QMP approach as described in Barber et al. (2023) implemented in Ardia et al. (2024), **Revisiting Boehmer et al. (2021): Recent Period, Alternative method, Different Conclusions**. 

By using the code, you agree to the following rules:

- You must cite the paper in working papers and published papers that use the code.
- You must place the DOI of this data/code repository in a footnote to help others find it.
- You assume all risk for the use of the code.

The computer code is written in SAS and intended for use on the WRDS server.

## Code

The file `Compute_RTQ_QMP.sas` identifies and signs retail trades with the QMP approach and computes daily-aggregated retail-trade quantities. See the comment section in the file for more details.

## Data

The data file `pseudo_taqsymlist.sas7bdat` is an illustrative list of TAQ symbols (SYM_ROOT and SYM_SUFFIX) defining the stock universe.

## Output

An output file named `rtq_qmp.sas7bdat` is saved after each run, and any previous content will be overwritten.
